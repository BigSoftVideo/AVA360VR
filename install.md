## How to install and run AVA360VR

From GitHub you will be able to download the latest build release of AVA360VR (v3.0.0-alpha3) and run it from Windows 10 on your computer.

Your system will need to fulfil certain requirements.

### Requirements

You will need a fast VR-ready laptop (eg. a gaming laptop) with Windows 10, as well as an HTC VIVE or VIVE PRO (preferable). Note: we will be supporting other headsets in future, eg. Oculus Rift S, VIVE Cosmos, HP Reverb, Valve Index - but they are not fully supported with this beta release. If you are unsure if you have a compatible laptop/workstation and VR headset/controllers, then just ask us.

You will need to install the HTC VIVE with Steam and Steam VR. An account will have to be created for Steam.

You will need to setup the HTC VIVE room space so tracking will work with the lighthouses.

### Downloading

Download the [latest build release](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR-beta-testing/releases) from GitHub (this will only work if you are logged into GitHub with your browser and are a member of the beta-testing group). 

When you download the build, you can also download the `AVA360VR-demo-package v1.0.zip` file. If you already have it, then there is no need to download it again unless it has been modified.

### Installing

Unzip the release of AVA360VR that you downloaded to a folder on your computer, preferably a fast SSD drive (internal or external). There is no need to install the software. Just locate the `AVA360VR.exe` file in the root folder and double click.

### Running

If you are running SteamVR with the HTV VIVE PRO, then AVA360VR will load a menu screen so you can load your demo project.

See the [demo](demo.md) and [help](help.md) projects to get started with some prepared projects that are open source.
