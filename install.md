## How to install and run AVA360VR

From GitHub you will be able to download the latest build release of AVA360VR and run it from Windows 10 on your computer.

Your system will need to fulfil certain requirements.

### Requirements

You will need a fast VR-ready laptop (eg. a gaming laptop) with Windows 10, as well as an HTC VIVE or VIVE PRO.

You will need to install the HTC VIVE with Steam and Steam VR. 

You will need to setup the HTC VIVE room space so tracking will work.

### Downloading

Download the [latest build release](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR-beta-testing/releases) from GitHub (this will only work if you are logged into GitHub with your browser and are a member of the beta-testing group). 

When you download the build, you can also download the `AVA360VR-demo-help.zip` package. If you already have it, then there is no need unless it has been modified.

### Installing

Copy it to a folder on your computer. There is no need to install the software. Just locate the `AVA360VR.exe` file in the root folder and double click.

### Running

If you are running SteamVR with the HTV VIVE, then AVA360VR will load a menu screen so you can load your demo project.

See the [demo](demo.md) and [help](help.md) projects to get started with some prepared projects that are open source.
