## How to contact the developers directly

You can contact us via the Slack public channel `#ava360vr` on https://bigvideo.slack.com.
You should be able to [subscribe to this channel by joining our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/bigvideo/shared_invite/zt-qklnkefp-ic9J6WK5e8TYlGWfWwApNw).
If this does not work, then ask us for an invite.

Please direct your questions and comments about AVA360VR to the Slack channel, where we can have a conversation to find answers.

On the other hand, [Bug reports](bugreport.md) and [feature requests](featurerequest.md) should be added to GitHub.

You can also discuss features, enhancements and bugs on our AVA360VR [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR/discussions) on GitHub.
