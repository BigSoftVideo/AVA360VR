## How to enter a feature request on GitHub

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancements to the tools already in AVA360VE, then you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR-beta-testing/issues/new?assignees=ArturKovacs%2C+skandilocks%2C+codeslayer84&labels=feature+request+%3Acrown%3A&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+) in GitHub for the beta-testing repository. A template will guide you what details to provide.
