## How to access help in VR

These GitHub help pages provide the basics to get started. Once you have installed AVA360VR and the demo and help projects package, then you can access help video tutorials and slides directly in AVA360VR without leaving VR.

The help tutorials are accessible from the demo project after it is loaded. Just go to the analysis mapping tool.
