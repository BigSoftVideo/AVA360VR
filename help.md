## How to access help in VR

These GitHub help pages provide the basics to get started. Once you have installed AVA360VR and the demo and help projects package, then you can access help video tutorials and slides directly in AVA360VR without leaving VR.

The help tutorials are accessible in VR from the [demo package](demo.md) after it is loaded.
Just go to the analysis mapping tool accessible from the left controller.

If you wish to go straight to the HELP project tutorials, then after running AVA360VR and selecting the LOAD screen, you can load the analysis version called `help-001` after switching to the `HELP` project in the `DEMO PACKAGE` folder.

Please submit a [suggestion how to improve the help pages and video tutorials](tutorialrequest.md).
