## How to submit a bug report in GitHub

If you have found a bug or have a problem with AVA360VR, then you can [create a bug report](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR-beta-testing/issues/new?assignees=ArturKovacs%2C+skandilocks&labels=bug+%3Abug%3A&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+) in GitHub.

After you submit, then we will be notified and can respond to the bug report.

If you wish to track how your bug report (or any other) is progressing, then you can see it on the [Project 'kanban' board](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/AVA360VR-beta-testing/projects/1).
