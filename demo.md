## How to download and setup the DEMO project for the first time

After you have [installed AVA360VR](install.md), you can unzip the demo package that contains all the files you need to try out a real example of a project.

It is best to unzip the package to a fast SSD drive (internal or external). 

The top folder will be the initial location of your MY PROJECTS. Under this folder you will see two more folders for two projects: LEGO and HELP.

To load the demo LEGO project, then from the main menu in AVA360VR choose the load option. Then browse for the SAVE file `lego001.sav` in the `MY PROJECTS/LEGO/Saves` folder.
