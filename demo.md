## How to download and setup the DEMO project for the first time

After you have [downloaded the demo package zip file](install.md), you can unzip the demo package since it contains all the files you need to try out a real example of a project. The pre-prepared projects contain [open data](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/data) that are public under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

It is best to unzip this package to a fast SSD drive (internal or external).

The top folder will be the initial location of your MY PROJECTS. Under this folder you will see more folders for six projects: HELP, HELP2, HELP3, PROBLEMS, CREATING-PROJECTS, LEGO-DEMO.

To load the welcome and introduction, then from the main menu in AVA360VR choose the load option. Then browse for the SAVE file `welcome-001` in the `HELP` project after you have switched to the location of your `DEMO PACKAGE` folder (that you unzipped after downloading the demo package). You will learn how to load other help tutorials. We recommend the basic tutorials on the controllers, playback, window controls and navigation.

After you have tried some help tutorials in VR, you can load the demo LEGO project. From the main menu in AVA360VR choose the load option. Then browse for the SAVE file `lego-demo1-001` in the `LEGO DEMO` project in the `DEMO PACKAGE` folder.
