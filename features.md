## Main features of _AVA360VR_

This is a list of some of the key features of AVA360VR according to different categories, with links and some indication of whether or not there is a tutorial video (📼) or 'VolCap' (🌐) available in the [Demo Package](demo.md).
At some point, all the VolCaps will also be available to download as 2D videos from an archive, but they cannot be included in the Demo Package because of space restrictions.
The VolCaps are 50 to 100 times smaller in MBytes than the equivalent video.
