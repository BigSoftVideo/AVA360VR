1. How to zoom in on the 360 video?
    - You can use several tools to do this.
    For example, the *mirror cam*, the *recam* and the *drawing/near-plane canvas* tools all have a zoom function built-in.
    Just open the tool, point it at the area of the 360 video you wish to see in more detail, and zoom to your heart's content.
    Of course, the digital zoom will not give you more detail than the pixel depth allows.
    Zooming is also built into the *comic creator/cameras* and the *keyframe sequencer* tools.
